# pic-sure-wildfly-docker


This project provides docker build instructions for the pic-sure wildfly container, and is used by the PIC-SURE-All-In-One build process as well as environments using avillachlab-jenkins build.  Two files are supplied, a default build containing the base pic-sure API and PSAMA, and an augmented build that also contains a pic-sure Aggregate Resource which can be used to enforce aggregation requirements for displaying small result counts.
